      <ul>
        <li>
          NEVER feed your furkid with avocado, chocolate, coffee and caffeine,
          citrus, coconut and coconut oil, grapes and raisins, macadamia nuts,
          milk and dairy, nuts, onions, garlic, chives, raw/undercooked
          meat/eggs/bones, salt and salty snack foods, xylitol and yeast dough
        </li>
        <li>
          Give your furkid deworm pill/tablet monthly. Based on individual
          circumstance, flea and tick treatment must be given periodically.
        </li>
        <li>
          Feed your puppy three times a day. After 8 months and older, you can
          reduce it to one to two times daily.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep your furkid at a cool place with good ventilation and ensure
          access to water.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not bring your french bulldog out for a run especially in noon or
          under the hot sun . They are prone to heat injury due to their
          inability to effectively dissipate heat from their body. The best
          timing will be in the evening time or early morning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not all dogs are good swimmer. French bulldog cannot swim naturally
          and require close monitoring and life vest when swimming.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not share human food with your furkid. The best practice is to give
          kibbles specially formulated for dogs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Different breed of dogs will need different exercise duration and
          intensity. Esp French bulldog, it needs minimal exercise. A stroll in
          the park will be sufficient for them. Compared to a large breed dog.
