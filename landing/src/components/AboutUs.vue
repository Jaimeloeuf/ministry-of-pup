        Ministry of Pup is founded by Angelynn and Cloris when they took a leap
        of faith to leave their full time jobs in retail and education in early
        2021, to set up a home for <i>Pawrents</i> to find their <i>Furkids</i>.
        It was not an easy decision to venture into this new journey, but being
        dog lovers, they envisage to reduce pet abandonment rates and provide
        support for their owners.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        The setup took nearly a year to complete, as it took comprehensive
        planning to ensure responsible breeding and help customers learn how to
        improve their pet's well-being. We strive to break away from how
        conventional pet shops operate, to create a new normal aimed at
        improving pet's welfare and to provide continuous support to our
        customers.
      </p>
      <br />

        Cloris and Angelynn have over a decade of experience as <i>Pawrents</i>.
        We had our fair share of bad experience in dealing with irresponsible
        breeders who were purely profit driven. We believe it is our
        responsibility to provide care and support even after our pets have
        found their forever home. Owning a pet should be fulfilling and
        enjoyable while being stress free.

        We live by the phrase,
        <i>
          "You have everything in the world, however, in the eyes of your pet.
          You are the world to them"
        </i>
