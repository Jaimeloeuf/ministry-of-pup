  Checks if the URL is a hash based URL requesting to cancel an appointment.
  If true, parse out the appointmentID, load the cancelAppointmentApp asynchronously and run the app.
  Else, run the standard booking app.
  
  All the views for the standard booking app is loaded directly,
  because most of the time users would be using this app to book.
  And to optimise for the most common path, the booking app is
  loaded optimistically to prevent asynchronously loading another
  JS file to run the actual main booking app.
  Only the cancel appointment app is loaded asynchronously as it
  is not the most common use case and is allowed to take more time.
